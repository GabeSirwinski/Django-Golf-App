# Django_Golf_App

This site was done as a solo project for my Python Live Project as part of the Tech Academy curriculum. 

I was given the task of creating a site having to do with a hobby of mine, so I naturally went to golf. 

This project was a ton of fun and opened the door to technologies I hadn't used before: webscraping and APIs. 

The News section of the site is scraped from PGA Tour news.

For the player list by season and the individual players, both make calls to a sports API. 

In order to save the players, I made a model that mirrored the JSON sent from the API. 

For the golf course search and weather, 3 APIs are called here. One to get latitude and longitude, another to search golf courses, and the third to get weather. 

The site is styled with JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Feel free to look around the code and definitely reach out to me if you have any questions or comments.

Feedback is very welcomed!

Thanks for stopping by - I look forward to hearing from you.
